# Platform Engineering

Welcome to the University of Oregon's platform engineering reference site. Here you'll find self-paced modules, tool guides, and reference material for the tools and practices that power our infrastructure.

## Getting Started

**New here?** Start with [Learning Modules](learn/index.md) and work through them in order. Each module includes hands-on exercises designed to run on your own machine.

**Need to set up your environment?** The [Tools](tools/index.md) section has installation guides for Git, PDK, VS Code, and platform-specific setup like Homebrew (macOS) and WSL (Windows).

## What's Here

| Section | What You'll Find |
|---------|------------------|
| [Learn](learn/index.md) | Structured training: Git fundamentals, Puppet basics, advanced Puppet topics |
| [Tools](tools/index.md) | Installation and configuration guides for development tools |
| [Concepts](concepts/index.md) | Background on infrastructure-as-code, version control, and related ideas |
| [Labs](lab-guides/index.md) | Companion guides for instructor-led lab sessions |
| [Handbook](handbook/index.md) | UO-specific conventions, workflows, and expectations |
