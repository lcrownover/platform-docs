# Virtual Resources and Collectors

TODO: Cover virtual resources, resource collectors, and when to use them.

Topics to cover:

- Virtual resources (`@` syntax) and why you'd defer realization
- Realizing resources with `realize()` and collectors (`<| |>`)
- Collector search expressions (`<| tag == 'webserver' |>`)
- Using collectors to override resource attributes
- Common use cases (user management across modules, conditional package installation)
