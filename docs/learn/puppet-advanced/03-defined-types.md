TODO: Cover creating reusable defined types.

Topics to cover:

- What defined types are vs. classes
- When to use a defined type (multiple instances vs. singleton)
- Defining and using a defined type
- Parameters and data types
- Namespacing and naming conventions
- Common patterns (managing multiple vhosts, database users, firewall rules)
