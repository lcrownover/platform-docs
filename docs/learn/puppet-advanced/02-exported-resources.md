# Exported Resources

TODO: Cover exported resources for cross-node configuration.

Topics to cover:

- What exported resources are and when you need them
- PuppetDB as the backing store
- Exporting resources (`@@` syntax)
- Collecting exported resources (`<<| |>>`)
- Common patterns (load balancer backends, SSH known hosts, monitoring targets)
- Gotchas (stale exports, ordering issues, PuppetDB latency)
