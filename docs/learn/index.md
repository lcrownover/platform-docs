## How to Use These Modules

1. **Check prerequisites.** Each module lists required tools and prior modules. Install what you need before starting.
2. **Work through sections in order.** Concepts build on each other.
3. **Use a scratch environment.** Create throwaway repos and VMs so you can experiment freely.
4. **Break things on purpose.** The best way to learn recovery is to need it.
