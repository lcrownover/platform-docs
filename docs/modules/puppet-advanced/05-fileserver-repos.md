# Fileserver Repos

TODO: Cover Puppet fileserver repositories for serving large or binary files.

Topics to cover:

- What fileserver repos are and when to use them
- Configuring custom mount points in `fileserver.conf`
- Serving files from locations outside of modules
- Use cases (large binaries, ISO images, installers, sensitive files with restricted access)
- The `puppet:///` URL scheme with custom mount points
- Access control and security considerations
