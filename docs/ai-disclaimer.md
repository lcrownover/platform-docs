## Why have this page? (Lucas's Responsible AI Use Soapbox)

As Uncle Ben once said, _"with great power comes great responsibility"_.
It's super easy nowadays to tell an AI to write the next great play that will rival Shakespeare.
That AI will gleefully dump out a metric ton of _seemingly_ good content.
You read the first few paragraphs and think they sound great!
Now, you want to get some peer feedback on your magnum opus, _(or maybe you just want to humble brag that you coerced technology into making something **totally novel**_), so you plop that baby into a Word doc and send it off to your friend.

Ask yourself, "_How much time did it take me to write this_, and _**how much time will it take them to review it**_?
Did you just absolve yourself of the responsibility of ownership by saddling your friend with it instead?

If you haven't read and approved, word for word, the entire content of whatever you're creating with AI, **before** sending it out to the folks who need it, **you are the problem**.
Respect eachother's time. Friends don't let friends publish AI slop.

**Use AI as a tool, don't defer to it**.

## Why are you yelling at me?

As you can see from the above rant, I am not Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini.
I don't have perfect pacing or formatting, my words come out rambly and informal.

**This is good. This is human. This is the sign of someone who has created content with care and intent.**

This is evidence that the author was passionate enough to spend more time than expected trying to communicate this information in a relatable and captivating way.

## The actual reason for this page

If you've read this far, it means that you probably care enough to know that this site (with the exception of this page) was mostly generated using AI (Claude specifically).

**However**

I have read every single byte of text that was placed in each file. I have made _numerous_ manual edits so these materials aren't just another pile of slop.
I hope that after reading this page, you understand _why that matters_, and I hope that you take my words to heart and practice responsible AI usage so that we can all live happily ever after.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk `<3`
