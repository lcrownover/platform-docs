# Puppet Labs

Hands-on labs covering Puppet configuration management, from writing your first manifest to advanced topics.

## Available Labs

| Lab | Description | Duration |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| [Puppet 101](puppet-101.md) | Install packages, manage files, use templates, and explore facts with `puppet apply` | Half day |
| [Puppet 102](puppet-102.md) | Advanced Puppet topics (coming soon) | Half day |

## What You'll Learn

**Puppet 101** starts from scratch on a fresh Linux server. You'll install nginx with a package resource, manage files with both inline content and ERB templates, wire up the Package/File/Service pattern with `notify`, and explore system facts with Facter. By the end, you'll have a working manifest that installs, configures, and manages a web server.

**Puppet 102** picks up where 101 left off with more advanced patterns. (Content coming soon.)
