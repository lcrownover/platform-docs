# Git Labs

Hands-on labs covering Git version control, from basic operations to collaborative workflows.

## Available Labs

| Lab | Description | Duration |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| [Git 101](git-101.md) | Clone, edit, stage, commit, push, pull, and resolve merge conflicts | 2 hours |
| [Git 102](git-102.md) | Branching, merging, reverting, stashing, and pull requests | 3 hours |

## What You'll Learn

**Git 101** gets you comfortable with the core workflow: cloning a repository, making changes, and pushing them back. You'll work in both a personal repo and a shared group repo, learning how to pull changes from others and resolve merge conflicts when two people edit the same file.

**Git 102** builds on that foundation with the tools teams use daily: creating branches to isolate work, merging branches back together, undoing mistakes, and opening pull requests for code review.
