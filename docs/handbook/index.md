# Handbook

This section covers how we do things at UO. While the Training section teaches general concepts and tools, the Handbook documents our specific conventions, workflows, and expectations.

## What's Here

- **Puppet at UO** - Our Hiera structure, module organization, and contribution workflow (coming soon)
- **Git Workflows** - How we use branches, PRs, and code review (coming soon)

## How to Use This Section

Read the Training modules first to understand the fundamentals. Then use the Handbook to learn how those concepts apply in our environment.
