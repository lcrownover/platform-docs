# Git 101

Git is a distributed version control system that records changes to files over time. It groups changes into commits you can compare, restore, and merge so parallel work stays orderly.

## Why Use Git?

- **Reliable history**: Create checkpoints instead of copying folders or renaming files.
- **Parallel work**: Branch to try ideas without blocking teammates; merge with a traceable story.
- **Audit-friendly**: Authors, timestamps, and messages make incident timelines and reviews clear.
- **Automation-ready**: Works with CI/CD, code review systems, and deployment pipelines.

## How This Module Works

- Complete lessons in order: **Prerequisites** → Local Foundations → Understanding History → Branching and Merging → Working with Remotes → Recovery and Confidence.
- Use a scratch repository so you can experiment freely and reset as needed.
- Run `git status` before and after changes to keep a clean working tree; don't be afraid to delete and re-create your sandbox if you get stuck.

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Module

- Initialize or clone repositories, set identity, and keep your working tree tidy.
- Stage, commit, and write intent-focused messages.
- Inspect diffs and history to understand who changed what and why.
- Branch, merge, and resolve small conflicts with confidence.
- Push, pull, and fetch from a remote using safe defaults.
- Recover from common mistakes without panic.
