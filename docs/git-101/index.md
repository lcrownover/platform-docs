# Git 101

Git is a distributed version control system that records changes to files in a project over time. It organizes those changes into commits, which form a history that can be navigated, compared, and restored. It also supports branching and merging so multiple lines of development can exist and be integrated.

## Why Use Git?

- **Change history**: Create checkpoints you can return to instead of duplicating files.
- **Parallel work**: Use branches to try ideas without blocking teammates; merge when ready with a documented trail.
- **Accountability**: Authors, timestamps, and commit messages make audits and incident timelines straightforward.
- **Integration**: Fits with CI/CD, code reviews, and deployment pipelines.

## What You’ll Be Able to Do After This Module

- Initialize and clone repositories, set identity, and keep a clean working tree.
- Stage, commit, and write messages that explain intent.
- Inspect diffs and history to understand who changed what and why.
- Branch, merge, and resolve small conflicts.
- Push and pull with a remote using safe defaults.

Start with **Prerequisites** to install Git and a terminal, then continue to the hands-on lessons. Keep a scratch repository handy so you can experiment without affecting real projects.
